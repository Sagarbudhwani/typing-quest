        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
        "Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.",

        "The best way to predict the future is to invent it.",
        "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad.",
        "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.",
        "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.",
        "The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.",
        "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.",
        "Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out."

        "The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language. It shapes the way you think about problems and solutions, and can either open your mind or constrain it.",
        "Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?'",
        "The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user. The first rule of programming is to write code that works.",
        "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.",
        "Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking. The act of writing code is just a small part of the overall process. Before you write a single line, you need to understand the problem.",
        "The best programmers are not those who write the most code or the fastest code, but those who write code that is easiest to understand and maintain over time.",
        "There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. The first is to write perfect code from the start. The second is to use extensive testing. The third is to accept that bugs will happen and design your systems to handle them gracefully.",
        "Programming languages are tools, not religions. A good craftsman knows many tools and selects the best one for the job at hand, rather than insisting on using the same tool for every job.",
        "The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively communicate ideas. Technical brilliance is useless if you can't explain your ideas to other people.",

        "The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively communicate ideas. Technical brilliance is useless if you can't explain your ideas to other people. This is true whether you're working on a team or contributing to open source projects. Clear communication makes collaboration possible.",
        "Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking. The act of writing code is just a small part of the overall process. Before you write a single line, you need to understand the problem, break it down into smaller pieces, and plan your approach. The best programmers spend more time thinking about solutions than actually implementing them.",
        "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. Always write code that is simple and straightforward, even if it means writing more lines. Your future self will thank you when it's time to fix bugs or add new features.",
        "The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language. It shapes the way you think about problems and solutions, and can either open your mind or constrain it. That's why it's important to learn multiple paradigms and languages early in your career, to broaden your perspective on how problems can be solved.",
        "Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' Comments should explain why the code exists, not what it does. If you find yourself writing comments that explain complex logic, consider refactoring the code to make the logic clearer instead.",
        "The best programmers are not those who write the most code or the fastest code, but those who write code that is easiest to understand and maintain over time. They understand that code is read much more often than it is written, and optimize for readability rather than cleverness or brevity.",
        "There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. The first is to write perfect code from the start. The second is to use extensive testing. The third is to accept that bugs will happen and design your systems to handle them gracefully. This means writing code that fails safely, provides useful error messages, and is easy to debug when things go wrong.",
        "Programming languages are tools, not religions. A good craftsman knows many tools and selects the best one for the job at hand, rather than insisting on using the same tool for every job. The more languages you learn, the better you understand programming concepts in general, and the more effective you become at solving problems.",
        "The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user. The first rule of programming is to write code that works. But beyond that, good code is maintainable, efficient, and understandable. It's not enough for the code to work today; it needs to continue working as requirements change and as other developers work with it.",
        "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious you can do to make it better. All the code appears to be written with the same attention to detail, the same consistent style, and the same thoughtful approach. When you read clean code, you can tell that the author was thinking about the next person who would read it, not just about getting it to work."
